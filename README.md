## Description

The web app will facilitate an "at home" color analysis as an attempt to remove both cost and transportation out of the equation. The first feature of our web app is an analysis quiz that will identify an individual as a certain color season. Depending on how we choose to implement the color analysis feature, there may be inaccuracies in the color analysis due to a narrow dataset of skin color used for AI training. For our second feature, individuals will be able to upload and share products that fit with their skin tones. Lastly, we will have a main page that contains all the products, split up into two sections of makeup and clothing, with filters including the color season that they work best for.
