            Problem Description
        </h2>
      
        <p>
            Color analysis is a process, fairly common when it comes to makeup and fashion,
            that aids individuals in determining the colors that best suit themselves based
            on their features. The results of color analysis are meant to accentuate an individual’s
            features, which, in turn, increases the individual’s self confidence. Normally,
            this process is done in-person during an appointment with a color analysis specialist.
            This process is fairly expensive, at least currently in the United States, due to its exclusivity.
            Appointments with a specialist, in the Greater Seattle area, can start at around $300 per person.
            With extreme scarcity when it comes to the number of specialists in the area and the unaffordable
            prices, there’s currently an issue with inaccessibility when it comes to color analysis and its benefits.
        </p>
      
        <p>
            Because of the lack of exposure there when it comes to this procedure, there are
            accessibility issues when it comes to individuals trying to find out what colors
            best suit them based on their features and the season they’d be correlated with.
            The lack of updated and accurate information about color analysis makes it difficult
            to identify the exact shades that work well on yourself. In a larger scope, by properly
            identifying the season and tone of colors that work with an individual’s features, there’s
            a stronger likelihood of increasing an individual’s confidence. Accurate color analysis
            allows an individual to understand how others perceive them and understand the types of
            products that could minimize the appearance of certain insecurities (like skin imperfections
            or blemishes).
        </p>
      
        <p>
            Some existing ways to get color analysis include using TikTok filters or putting your hex
            code into ChatGPT. There is a specific filter on the platform, TikTok, that allows users to
            get a color analysis through their skin tone as a reference for styling their appearance. However,
            this filter lacks accuracy as it will give the same person different results each time.
            Alternatively, by entering the hex codes of the user’s skin color in natural lighting into ChatGPT,
            they can receive a comprehensive color analysis. Yet, this method of an AI-generated approach can
            lead to reliability concerns.
        </p>
      
        <p>
            By increasing the access to color analysis tools, this web application will not only help
            individuals elevate their personal style but also improve self-confidence. It offers
            a tailored guide for each user, revealing what colors look the best on them. This goes
            beyond just visual aesthetics but can also positively increase their self-image and well-being,
            leading to better social confidence and personal satisfaction.

            App Description
        </h2>
      
      <p>
        For this project, our target audience is anyone who wants to have a better understanding of what colors flatter their 
        appearance and the corresponding products they could wear and use to accentuate their features. The web app will facilitate 
        an "at home" color analysis as an attempt to remove both cost and transportation out of the equation. The first feature of our 
        web app is an analysis quiz that will identify an individual as a certain color season. Depending on how we choose to implement 
        the color analysis feature, there may be inaccuracies in the color analysis due to a narrow dataset of skin color used for AI training. 
        For our second feature, individuals will be able to upload and share products that fit with their skin tones. If time permits, we may 
        have an additional feature where users would be able to make boards containing the different products that work for them, allowing 
        other users to also access them. Lastly, we will have a main page that contains all the products, split up into two sections of 
        makeup and clothing, with filters including the color season that they work best for.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Since it is difficult to find datasets for cosmetic products and clothing based on color analysis, we are planning to collect data ourselves 
        and categorize the information based on the color season and tones. The information will be from the website called “Created Colorful”, 
        which recommends fashions and cosmetics based on color analysis. When using feature 2, users can also upload data that will become part of the data collection. 
        For example, if people find certain cosmetic products or clothing suitable for a particular tone and season, they can upload pictures with specific 
        details such as the product type, price, and where they got them from. By creating this web application, we believe that it will significantly 
        enhance accessibility to color analysis without cost. It will make people convenient by offering color analysis and product recommendations 
        anytime and anywhere. Moreover, it will improve their understanding of personal style and confidence in their styling.
